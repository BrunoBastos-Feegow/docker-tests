Virtualization for Windows 10/11 Home Editions
=====
- this folder contains scripts to enable virtualization on Windows 10/11 Home Editions
- be aware that home editions of Microsoft Windows 10/11 do not support virtualization nativly
- that being said, you can still use virtualization since your hardware supports this feature. You can check that whithin the BIOS of your computer
- if the BIOS does not support virtualization, I am sorry to inform, but you can NOT use virtualization on your computer

> REMEMBER: God and the Developer have a deal: God doesn't do code, and the Developer doesn't do miracles.
